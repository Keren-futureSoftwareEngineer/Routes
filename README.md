# Request and Response Handling

## Overview
I created this practice repo to demonstrate some route handling basics

### Installation
Basic front end dependecies include node, express, jquery react, reactDOM, axios, and babel for webpack configuration.


### Installing Dependencies
In the terminal, run $ npm install

### Running the app
Build the webpack bundle by running 'npm run build'
In a separate teminal window, start the server by running 'npm start'

### Files that you dont need
index.js and index2.html were from my original vanilla js version. They are not necessary with the current react version
